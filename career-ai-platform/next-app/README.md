CB-AI Next.js scaffolding (TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn)

This is a minimal Next.js v13+ + TypeScript project skeleton that hosts the ShaderAnimation and LuminaInteractiveList components.

- Start: navigate to career-ai-platform/next-app
- Install deps: npm install
- Run: npm run dev
- Open: http://localhost:3000

Note: This patch focuses on UI/UX scaffolding and a skeleton app to demonstrate the components. It can be extended into a full PRD-aligned platform.
